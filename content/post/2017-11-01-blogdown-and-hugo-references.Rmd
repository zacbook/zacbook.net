This is a simple list of references for Blogdown and Hugo.

- [Hugo Documentation](//gohugo.io/documentation/)
- [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](//bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill
- [Integrating Blogdown with GitHub Pages and Travis-CI](//wjakethompson.github.io/post/blogdown-gh-pages-travis-ci/) by Jake Thompson. This is not how I currently deploy this blog, but am keeping it for potential future reference. It's also a great example of the use of the [Academic theme](//themes.gohugo.io/academic/).

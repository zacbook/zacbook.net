In configuring either a Hugo or Jekyll blog, one comes across the YAML and TOML markup languages. This is a list of handy references that I have found.

- The [TOML Github Page](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) describes TOML syntax.
- An example of [TOML vs. YAML](https://gist.github.com/cdsousa/9c98897595177ed322b24643af4b68ce), useful for quickly gauging which style you prefer.
- The [Hugo Configuration Page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) describes the TOML and YAML variables for Hugo.

By default, Blogdown uses the system Python installation. To tell Blogdown to use a different version of Python, e.g., Python 3 installed via Homebrew, one needs to configure a different engine in Knitr:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path = list(python = '/usr/local/bin/python3'))
```

I include this line in my `~/.Rprofile`. Now you can test to ensure that it is using the specified version of Python:

```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)
```

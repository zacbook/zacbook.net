      <description>This post no longer reflects my current practice. I’ve switched to deploying from a separate branch that contains the rendered html. As such, I now ignore the html files within /contentand no longer include generated content within /static.

Being a fan of version control, and perhaps Git in particular, I naturally keep the source to my website in a Git repository. However, starting out with Blogdown and Hugo, I wasn’t sure what exactly should be stored in Git versus relying on the generated output of Blogdown or Hugo.</description>
